### Assignment 3:
This week among other things, we were asked to “Introduce a DB abstraction layer in your ITU-MiniTwit”. 
We decided to use Microsoft’s Entity Framework Core as the ORM. Other common options are NHibernate or Linq2Db. 
The reasons for choosing EF Core over the other solutions, is due to its popularity and applicability with .NET web applications. 
We are also interested in gaining experiences with a solution that could benefit our career possibilities. 
Furthermore, EF Core is developed and supported directly by Microsoft, and therefore, it’s mature and it’s likely that it will be stable and updated looking forward. 

In regards to NHibermate, EF core is quite similar, but we experienced that EF Core has more documentation available. 
Lastly, Linq2Db is a light-weight ORM with great performance as one of its main strengths, however as of now, performance doesn’t seem to be the main requirement of our system. 

We decided to keep SQLite as the DBMS, because of convenience and popularity. 
SQLite is compatible with EF core and meets all our current requirements. 
In the following weeks we will be discussing alternative solutions such as the various noSQL systems.
