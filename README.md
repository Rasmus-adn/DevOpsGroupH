> This project revolves around a forum application called minitwit. The functionalities includes signing up, logging in, posting messages, following other users. The forum has a public timeline where all messages are displayed. Furthermore, if a user is signed in, a personal timeline exists that displays a users own messages aswell as messages of followed users.

## How to run the application

### Development Environement (utilizing local database in /temp)

To run the application locally, run the following command in the mvc-minitwit repository: `dotnet watch run -p mvc-minitwit.csproj`

Server running on port http://localhost:5000

To run tests of the application locally, run the following command in the HomeControllerTests repository: `dotnet test`

### Production Environment (utilizing sql server on azure)

The `azure-pipelines.yml` runs the tests, builds the dockerfile and pushes it to dockerhub, where azure listens.
The application is hosted on the following web-service domain: https://neutrals-minitwit.azurewebsites.net/

The docker-compose file in `mvc-minitwit` contains our monitoring and logging applications, which is being hosted on another webservice and are therefore not part of the azure-pipeline. When the `docker-compose.yml` is being build, it is pushed to dockerhub, where azure is listening.
The monitoring and logging applications are hosted on the following web-service domain: https://minitwit-neutrals.azurewebsites.net/
